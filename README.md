There are 2 Files For SuperStore Project(Sample and Full)
1. Sample: This one contains Few Queries just for demonstration purpose,
  to showcase my MYSQL Skills like (Structured Query Writing, Using of Temporary Tables, Window Functions, Working with Dates, Rollups, Pivoting of Tables
  Subqueries(Double, Tripple), Working with CTE's and using some usefull functions)
2. Full or Main: This File Contains all the Queries For Data Analysis. It is Big in size and has Over 80 Questions and its solutions and is of Over 800 Lines.
   Here I have everything which I though would be usefull to find insights of.
   (Few Queries could not be in a Proper Structure. Please Pardon me for it)
